Chris-Anne Rowe — Software Engineer (Healthcare • Enterprise • SaaS)

I build scalable, user‑focused applications for healthcare, fintech, and enterprise teams. My work spans patient systems, reporting engines, clinical workflows, and complex data‑driven dashboards. I specialize in React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and modern tooling across distributed teams.

Case Studies:

     1. Patient Registry & Clinical Workflow Dashboard
        
    Overview
    A diagnostic center needed a unified dashboard to manage patient intake, demographics, studies, and clinical workflows. Their existing process relied on spreadsheets and manual data entry, causing delays and inconsistent records.
    
    My Role
    - Led frontend architecture and implementation
    - Designed UX flows for patient creation, editing, and study assignment
    - Integrated with backend services and validated data models
    - Implemented role‑based access and audit logging
    - Collaborated with clinicians to refine workflows
      
    Tech Stack
    Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Flowbite, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma
    
    Impact
    - Reduced patient intake time by 40%
    - Eliminated duplicate records and improved data accuracy
    - Enabled clinicians to access patient and study data in seconds
    - Created a scalable foundation for future modules (billing, reporting)
    
     2. Real‑Time Reporting & Analytics Engine
        
    Overview
    Management needed visibility into daily studies, revenue, modality usage, and technician performance. Reports were manually compiled and often delayed by days.
    
    My Role
    - Designed and implemented the reporting UI and backend endpoints
    - Optimized SQL queries and added indexes to improve performance
    - Option to add caching and pagination for large datasets
    - Worked closely with management to define KPIs and metrics
      
    Tech Stack
    Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma
    
    Impact
    - Reduced report generation time from hours to seconds
    - Enabled leadership to make data‑driven decisions
    - Improved operational transparency across branches
    - Became the most‑used module by management
    
     3. Doctor & Address Management Workflow (UX‑Focused)
        
    Overview
    Doctors had multiple practice locations, each with different billing codes, contact details, and study preferences. Staff struggled to maintain accurate records, leading to billing errors and misrouted reports.
    
    My Role
    - Refactored the entire doctor/address workflow
    - Implemented dynamic forms with safe defaults and fallback logic
    - Added validation, error boundaries, and optimistic UI updates
    - Improved UX with modals, inline editing, and clear visual hierarchy
    - Collaborated with backend team to refine API payloads
    - 
    Tech Stack
    React, Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind
    
    Impact
    - Reduced data entry errors by 70%
    - Improved staff efficiency and reduced training time
    - Created a maintainable, scalable module used across multiple workflows
    - Became the internal standard for future form-heavy features

Remote Collaboration & Delivery
- 5+ years working with distributed teams across time zones, delivering features reliably in remote‑first environments
- Strong async communication using Slack, Jira, GitHub
- Experience owning features end‑to‑end: design → implementation → QA → release
- Comfortable breaking down ambiguous requirements and proposing solutions
- UX‑driven approach with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and maintainability
